Subject: First CET meeting-Yu PEI 
Hi ,

About my first CET meeting, I would like to check with you first, which dates would be more convenient for you?

I am writing to schedule a meeting to my first CET meeting. 

Dear beloved team,

I hope you all had a nice summer. As people are starting to come back to the office, I would like to organize the brainstorming sessions we were suppose to do on our last SerVal day.

I picture 1-2 hours where the participants quickly present 2-3 slides about a problematic of their interest before we move to open discussions. Depending on the number of participants we will adapt on the timing.

 

So letâ€™s first schedule a date. If you are interested in joining us, please answer this Doodle: https://doodle.com/meeting/participate/id/b6RBzjlb

We will probably switch to a group conversation after that.


Cheers!
